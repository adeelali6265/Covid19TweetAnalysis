# Covid19TweetAnalysis
Explore Covid-19 related tweets and trends between this year and last using Natural Language Processing

Abstract: The topic of COVID-19 contains many subtopics that have trended and disappeared
over the last year. To capture key differences of trends between this year and last, a data set of 
COVID-19 related tweets taken in 2020 was compared to a similarly captured data set taken 
recently. After performing pre-processing techniques such as lowercasing, tokenization, 
lemmatization, stemming, and removing stopwords/punctuation, both data sets were prepared for 
visual analysis. Through bar charts, specifically chosen trends were compared by frequency and 
by sentiment. The results of visual analysis showed certain trends such as ‘Biden’ and 
‘mandates’ from this year and ‘lockdown’ from last year were not as common as expected, but 
were both viewed in net positive sentiments. Meanwhile ‘vaccine’ and ‘test’ were as common as 
expected from last year and were viewed in positive sentiment as well. The trend of positive
sentiment suggests people are receptive to changes in the COVID-19 situation by policy and 
leadership.
